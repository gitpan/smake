  SMake -- Makefile generator

  Version 1.2b1 (04-05-1997)

  SMake is a powerful mechanism to generate standard Makefiles out of skeleton
  Makefiles which only provide the essential parts.  The missing stuff gets
  automatically filled in by shared include files. A great scheme to create a
  huge Makefile hierarchy and to keep it consistent for the time of
  development.   The trick is that it merges the skeleton and the templates in
  a priority-driven way. The idea is taken from X Consortiums Imake, but the
  goal here is not inherited system independency, the goal is consistency and
  power without the need of manually maintaining a Makefile hierarchy.
